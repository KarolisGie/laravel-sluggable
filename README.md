# Laravel Sluggable

A trait to use on your models to generate slugs based on another column. Supports translated attributes (using [spatie/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable)).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require whitecube/laravel-sluggable
```

## Usage

``` php
<?php

namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\Sluggable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;
    
    public function sluggable(): string
    {
        return 'title';
    }
}
```



### Changing the destination column

By default, the slug is configured to be stored in a column named `slug` in the database. You can overwrite this setting with the `public $sluggableAttribute` property on your model.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\Sluggable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;
  
    public $sluggableAttribute = 'custom-slug-column';
    
    public function sluggable(): string
    {
        return 'title';
    }
}
```



### Route Model Binding

Be advised that this package overrides the `getRouteKeyName` method, which means [Laravel's Route Model Binding](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/routing#route-model-binding) will use the slug column by default (or the `$sluggableAttribute` you have defined). In most cases, this is great, saves you a step and cleans up your models, but if you must, you can change it to whatever you like.



### Translated slugs

You can generate slugs based on translated attributes (using [spatie/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable)). Remember to add the `slug` column to the `public $translatable` array to easily access them.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\Sluggable;
use Spatie\Translatable\HasTranslations;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;
    use HasTranslations;
  
    public $translatable = ['title', 'slug'];
    
    public function sluggable(): string
    {
        return 'title';
    }
}
```

```php
Post::create([
    'title' => [
        'en' => 'The title',
        'fr' => 'Le titre'
    ]
]);

$post->getAttributes()['slug']; // ['en' => 'the-title', 'fr' => 'le-titre']
$post->slug; // the-title (given that the crrent app locale is 'en')
$post->translate('slug', 'fr'); // 'le-titre'
```



### Cross-language redirects

If the slug provided in the URL does not correspond to an available current-language slug, but corresponds to a slug in another language, this package can automatically redirect to the proper slug.

An example: given the above example's post, we can access it this way

```php
/en/posts/the-title
// or
/fr/articles/le-titre
```

But if we visit `/fr/articles/the-title`, the package will automatically perform a `301` redirect to `/fr/articles/le-titre`.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `public $disableCrossLangRedirect = true;` on your model, in which case visiting  `/fr/articles/the-title` will just render a `404` page.
